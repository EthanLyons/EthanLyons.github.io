## Whole Brain Passion Project
 My name is Ethan Lyons and I want to create a film called the divider one day.
 I want to logically apply as many parts of cinematography to make a truly artistic masterpiece.
 Once I have a standard yet unique approach to things I wish for the creative side to come in.
 I will apply my creativity and imagination into 3D work and storytelling.
 Many meaningful events will transpire in the real world when a meaningful film is created with passion.

## Elevator Pitch
Hi my name is Ethan. I write website backend code, that helps local business grow their reach.
Im planning on starting up my business to open up new opportunities for others and myself.
Are you in the advertising business. Here’s my contact info lets meet up sometime
 
### Website Link Categorizer
### App Name: JLinker

 ## User stories
 
 I am in need of a one stop shop for all of my websites, links, videos, so on and so forth.
 This solves my problem because it gives me a less cluttered user experience compared to most
 web browser bookmarking systems.
 
 This program solves my need to store links for all of my songs and tracks. Many songs
 are found on many different streaming services. Many are unavaliable on respective services.
 I can put links to each song on here and have them all in one place regardless of services.
 
 This app is in fact useful on it's own. I would imagine I am not the only one
 who is in need of a categorization of often visited websites.
 




### Week 1 reflection

It has been difficult to adjust to the schedule so far. We have been introduced to many new concepts and are moving quickly.
The coding bootcamp is a promising. Most difficult part is adjusting to the schedule.


### Week 2 reflection

Things are getting easier and I am grasping concepts more appropriately. I am starting to enjoy learning and the other students have been helpful as well as instructors. Still struggling with 
Adjusting to the schedule, as I am not sleeping enough. We are starting to learn more about object oriented programming.

### Week 3 reflection

I am trying my hardest to learn this week as we are grasping newer concepts and starting to focus more on android programming which has been fun. I can't really seem to find the prodev
instructions easily, that bothers me. 5 or 6 other students seem to have the same issue. This week focused on concepts such as changing the orientation and keeping its data. Overall a good
week with a lot accomplished.

### Week 4 reflection

Week four has definitely been the hardest. We have been doing alot of object oriented programming and have been working hard nonstop since monday. We've had some fun with pro-dev intermittently
and that has been a great blessing. I feel as if I am falling behind on some concepts and will be needing to ask for help to catch up on those.
